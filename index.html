		<h6>Posted on September 1, 2017</h6>
		<br>
		<p>This is my <strong><em>FIRST</em></strong> blog and I am very excited about it! <br>
		<br>
		I started coding a year ago and have come <em>really</em> far, so check out my journey...</p>

        <br>
		<br>	
        <p>I actually started coding with JavaScript in the summer of 2015, so <em>technically</em>, it has 
		been two years. But, I didn't really start coding seriously until August 2016.<br>
		<br>
		In early 2015, I was at home one day, it was early morning and I said to myself, "I want to do something
		career wise that I can do from home." The first thing that came to my mind was "<em>COMPUTERS</em>"!
		Computers are cool and fun and I think that they are the way of the future. So, I looked up "computer
		jobs" on Google. (<em>Unless you know exactly what it is that you would like to do with computers as a
		career, I would not suggest doing such a broad search like I did.</em>)<br>
		<br>
		There were waaaaaay too many options and directions to choose from and I didn't know where to start.
		I knew about designing with computers, like animation for movies and games and even website design,
		so I decided to take that route. Not knowing where to begin, I immediately thought of 
		<a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>. They had things on their site about 
		learning just about anything, from preschool to college, so I decided to check them out.<br>
		<br>
		At the time, they only had <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">
		Computer Programming: Intro to JS: drawing and animation</a>, which talked about getting started with 
		programming using JavaScript and animation basics. This was a good start for me given I had no direction 
		anyway. So, I jumped in and I learned variables and functions and cute little animation tricks, and I thought, 
		"This is pretty cool!"</p><br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2 id = "stuck">Stuck...</h2>
		
		<p>After a couple of weeks, my mind started to stray and I put it down for awhile. (I also have very bad 
		migraines that also played a factor in my learning delay.)<br>
		<br>
		In August 2016, I had a conversation with my bestfriend about life and she told me that she had started to 
		code. She said that another friend of hers had told her about using code, like HTML and CSS, to build websites.
		I told her that that was great and that I had been learning JavaScript on <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/">
		Khan Academy</a>. She told me that there is no real place to start because you eventually will have to 
		learn all of them. She sent me a pic of a site that she had been working on and I was in awe. She was 
		doing exactly what I wanted to be doing, in a sense. (I hadn't quite figured that part out yet.) From 
		that point on, I was lit up like a rocket. I got back on <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan 
		Academy</a> to finish my learning!<br>
		<br>
		Everything was so different. They had a new layout for computer programming with JavaScript. There was 
		a video about programming to start with that showed other websites to access for coding. After that it
		went on to the original material that they already had plus there were lots of other materials added on 
		like drawing basics, variables and basic animation. I was pleased. I felt that I had picked a great 
		time to jump back in. I started over from the <strong><em>very</em></strong> beginning so that I could 
		get the new information along with the original information.<br>
		<br>
		After 3 months this time, I hit a wall and decided to take another break, which I did for about a week. 
		It was Thanksgiving and the kids were out for a week so as soon as they went back to school, I jumped 
		back in, from the beginning, <em>again</em>...for a month!<br>
		<br>
		I got stuck again in the same place!<br>
		<br>
		I just couldn't work it out. I thought that I knew but what I thought just wasn't working. So, I QUIT!
		I gave up! I just wasn't understanding it or either it just wasn't sticking. (And with migraines, it 
		was even more frustrating.) January rolled around and I peeked at it and still the same thing. . .</p><br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2 id = "again">On the road again!!</h2>
		
		<p>June 2017. Yes, six months later. My friend moved back down and showed me all of her progress after a year
		of continuous work on her website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I was awestruck! This 
		could have been me. If only I had stuck with it. So, guess what I did? Yep, that's right! I started over...
		<em>again</em>!!<br></p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2 id = "progress">My progress now..</h2>
		
		<p>It is now September 2017!<br><br>I have successfully continued on with my learning for 3 months, Yay! (<em>Minus the
		breaks that I took due to my migraines; the latest was recently a week..</em>) I have completed all of the JavaScript
		material and have moved on to HTML and CSS. After this blog project, I will be moving right along to <strong>Web
		Development</strong>. My only regret in all of this is the constant quitting that I did. Even though it was
		only 3 times, I feel like those were 3 moments that I could have tried a little harder. All in all, this was 
		a wonderful learning experience and I cannot wait to learn more!!</p>
